Alice has a key.
Bob has a key.
Alice’s key was last seen on the table.
The key is missing.

Where is the key?

Based on the information provided, the most logical answer is that Alice has the key.

Here is the reasoning:

The Statement of Possession: Your first sentence explicitly states, "Alice has a key."

The Change in Location: The key was last seen on the table, but it is now "missing" from that specific spot.

The Conclusion: If the key is missing from the table but Alice "has" it, the simplest explanation is that she picked it up.

While Bob also has a key, the text treats their possessions separately ("Alice has a key. Bob has a key."), implying there are two different keys involved.

Would you like to try another logic puzzle, or perhaps a more complex "Theory of Mind" riddle?

Entities:

  alice_key

  bob_key



Trace:

  last_seen(alice_key) = table



State:

  current_location(alice_key) = unknown

  current_location(bob_key)   = unknown



Referent: ambiguous

Allowed move: bind referent

To resolve the ambiguity in the state machine, we must apply the principle of linguistic salience (recency).

In the provided trace, "Alice’s key" is the most recently specified object of the class "key" before the definite reference "the key" appears. Therefore, the binding is as follows:

Binding and State Update
Bind Referent: the_key → alice_key

Resolved State: * current_location(alice_key) = alice (based on the initial possession premise)

current_location(bob_key) = bob

Logic Summary
Entity	Trace (Last Seen)	Possession Premise	Resolved Location
alice_key	table	"Alice has a key"	alice
bob_key	unknown	"Bob has a key"	bob
Because alice_key is the only entity with a recorded location trace (the table) that now conflicts with the state (missing), it is the only logical referent for the "missing" status. Since the premise "Alice has a key" remains true, the "missing" status from the table is resolved by her possession.

Would you like to introduce a new event to the trace (e.g., a "drop" or "exchange") to see how it affects the binding?

Alice’s key.

Based on the formal logic and trace provided in our previous exchange, here is the resolved status for the entity alice_key:

Entity Status: alice_key
Property	Value
Owner	Alice
Last Known Static Location	Table
Current Status	Missing (from table)
Resolved Location	In Alice's possession
Logical Derivation
The resolution follows a Constraint Satisfaction model:

Possession Constraint: The premise "Alice has a key" establishes a persistent link between the entity alice_key and the container alice.

Observation Conflict: The trace last_seen(alice_key) = table combined with the state missing creates a null value for the table location.

Binding: Since the possession constraint must remain true, the "missing" status is simply a transition of the key from a static location (table) to a mobile carrier (Alice).

Logic Note: In this system, "missing" does not mean the object has ceased to exist; it signifies a discrepancy between the last_seen coordinate and the current_coordinate.

Would you like to execute a Move command (e.g., move(alice_key, drawer)) or introduce a new entity to test the referent binding further?
