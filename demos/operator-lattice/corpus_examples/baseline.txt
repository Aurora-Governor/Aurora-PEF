We clarify the initial goal of the project.
Then we identify the core requirements.
Because several requirements depend on external systems, we note potential risks.
But some risks are uncertain, so we map degrees of likelihood.
Then we outline the first round of solutions.
Because early solutions reveal gaps, we revise the problem definition.
But revisions introduce new constraints we must respect.
Then we refine the short list of viable approaches.
If a key assumption fails during refinement, we adjust the approach accordingly.
Then we formalize the working draft.
