We begin with a simple working hypothesis.
Then we gather initial evidence that appears to support it.
But a conflicting dataset emerges from an independent source.
Because the conflict is too large to ignore, we re-examine our methods.
But re-examination reveals further inconsistencies in our assumptions.
Then we construct an alternative hypothesis that fits both datasets.
But the alternative clashes with established theory.
Because the clash could signal a deeper issue, we resist discarding it too quickly.
Then we design a decisive experiment to discriminate between the hypotheses.
If the decisive experiment favours the original view, we retain it with revisions.
If it favours the alternative, we update our theoretical framework.
